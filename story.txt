This is the beginning of our story..

Rammstein decided to go on tour.
So I got in my porche and went to get tickets.
I first stopped by the Backerei for some Apfelkuchen.
Then I headed to the wettbewerbsfaehig Apfelkuchen eating contest. I won!
I did not feel weel afterwards as each Apfelkuchen tasted like Bratwurst in Lederhose.
I decided to take a nap at the Biergarten, but I woke up in a new BMW.
To my surprise Dr. Mehlhase was in the passenger seat eating Gebaeck.
So I suddenly poured Klimmanlage into my hair and started barking like a Hund.
And Dr. Mehlhase found that so amusing that she gave my team and I a perfect grade in SER316. Then we had Doener.
When I woke up in my Schloss Eltz, I thought what a weird but pleasant dream.
Dazed by the dream, I stumbled out of bed and went to my closet to pick out my outfit, but to my surprise all I had was Dirndel, mainly a few sets of Lederhose.
Knowing I could not visit the ratskeller dressed like this, I got on the Hauptstrasse and headed to the mall to purchase some new clothes.
